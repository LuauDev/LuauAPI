# üåø LuauAPI
An executor made for the web version of Roblox.

LuauAPI uses a common method of writing unsigned bytecode into a Roblox core module script to manage execution. It's more stable and flexible than most executors that utilize this method.

## üåü Features
- **Fast Execution**: Enjoy quick script execution without lag.
- **Multi-Instance Compatibility**: Run multiple instances seamlessly.
- **Script Support**: Executes most scripts, including Lua Armor scripts.
- **Efficient Virtual Filesystem**: Extremely fast and syncs with external files.
- **Performance**: No in-game performance impact and minimal CPU usage.
- **Custom Functions**: Includes functions like HttpSpy, getting the real address of an instance, and setting/getting globals across clients.

### HttpGet Interference
The current method of adding **HttpGet** to `game` may interfere with some scripts, such as [**dex**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infyiff/backup/main/dex.lua). To execute dex, run the following script:

```lua
getgenv().game = workspace.Parent
```

This will remove **HttpGet** from `game`. You can also use the modified version of dex made for Xeno inside the released files.

## üì¶ Dependencies
This project uses the following libraries:

- [**httplib**](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib)
- [**xxhash**](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash)
- [**zstd**](https://github.com/facebook/zstd)
- [**openssl**](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)

Dependencies are managed with [**vcpkg**](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). Install them with this command:

```sh
vcpkg install xxhash zstd openssl
```

The proper version of **httplib** is already included in this project.
